# PythonHandMouse
Using Python and using a webcam, I have made it so that when you enable this script, it will track your hand with your camera to move your mouse. You can click and right click. This is still in testing phase. After downloading this, install Python 3.10, and run in your terminal "pip install opencv-python mediapipe pynput screeninfo" and then run the file. Enjoy!
